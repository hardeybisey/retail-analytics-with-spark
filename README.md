# Retail Analytics with Spark

This project demonstrates building a scalable e-commerce analytics pipeline with Apache Spark, transforming raw data into analytics-ready datasets. This project follows the dimensional models and business rules documented in the [Retail Analytics with Dbt](https://github.com/hardeybisey/retail-analytics-with-dbt) project, providing a hands-on guide to end-to-end data/analytics engineering at scale.
